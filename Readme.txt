Project Topic - Deep Learning Based Mulri-class Wild Pest Detection approch Using Mobilenet Algorithm. 

1. Data Collection. 
	Here, we are using image dataset for this project. 
	We are taken 9 classes of dataset. 

2. Data Pre processing. 
	It is process of reducing null values, noisy data,etc...
	Here, we are using image data generator for pre processing. 

3. Implementation of Model. 
	MobileNet

4. Model summary

5. Training the model. 

6. Final prediction for the accuracy value(graph)
